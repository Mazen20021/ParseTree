# Description :
#### The project is Semi Compiler That is Divided into two separated project Parser and Scanner 
### Parser:
#### The parser is a crucial component of the project responsible for analyzing the structure of input data or code according to a specified grammar or set of rules. It takes the output from the scanner (or tokenizer) and processes it further to understand the relationships and meanings within the input. The parser typically generates a data structure, such as a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST), representing the hierarchical structure of the input.
The parser will likely perform tasks such as:
#### Syntax Analysis: Checking whether the input adheres to the grammar rules defined for your language or data format.
#### Semantic Analysis: Verifying the correctness of the input beyond its syntax, such as variable declarations, type checking, etc.
#### Error Handling: Detecting and reporting syntax or semantic errors in the input.
#### AST Generation: Constructing an abstract representation of the input that can be used for further processing or interpretation.
The parser is often a fundamental component in compilers, interpreters, and other language processing tools. Its accuracy and efficiency significantly impact the performance and usability

### Scanner (Tokenizer):
#### The scanner, also known as the tokenizer or lexer, is the initial stage of the language processing pipeline. Its primary function is to break down the input stream of characters into meaningful tokens or lexemes, which are the smallest units of syntax in your language or data format.The scanner will typically perform the following tasks:
#### Tokenization: Dividing the input stream into tokens based on predefined patterns or regular expressions.
#### Removing Whitespace and Comments: Filtering out irrelevant characters like spaces, tabs, and comments that do not contribute to the syntax or semantics of the input.
#### Identifying Keywords and Symbols: Recognizing keywords, operators, punctuation marks, and other language-specific symbols.
#### Error Handling: Detecting and reporting lexical errors, such as invalid characters or unrecognized tokens.
The scanner plays a crucial role in preparing the input for further processing by the parser. Its efficiency and accuracy directly impact the performance and reliability of your project, especially in handling large volumes of input data or code.

# How To Run :
#### You Can Find Both Short Cuts of the exe files in Launcher Folder if not working so you can find Parser .exe File in (ParseTree\Parser\bin\Debug\Parser.exe) And Scanner.exe in (ParseTree\dist\Debug\MinGW-Windows\compiler_project.exe)

# System Requirements :
### Scanner :

- Windows 7 or higher
- Maximum 1GB Ram
- No Graphic Card Required 

### Parser :
- Windows 7 or higher
- Maximum 1GB Ram
- .net 4.5 or Higher
- No Graphic Card Required 

# VIP Note : 
#### The Tokens File Is Stored In (D:\Compiler Project\ParseTree) or The Location You Choose and Source File Must Be In Either The Location You Choose Or In This Location (D:\Compiler Project\ParseTree\launcher)

# Written Language :
- The Parser Is Written With C# 
- Scanner Is Written With C++
